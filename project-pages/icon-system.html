                We began with a rough style and a fun goal—creating 8–10 icons for the team page which was in
                progress
                then.

                While creating the initial icons was quick and straightforward, designing finance-related ones
                required
                deeper thought. We had to account for overlaps with numerous financial terms and ensure they
                carried
                a
                distinctly Indian touch.

                With time, we decided on how to use the colours and elements to use, consistent corner radius,
                overlap
                between elements since it was colour-glass, we couldn’t have messed up with both clarity of thought
                and
                the visual. Also, not to forget, dark theme.

                We went beyond simply creating the package in Figma. Instead, with a lot of help from Shekhar,
                Adi
                and
                Pankaj, we made the icons open source on Crucible, allowing everyone to easily copy them into
                slides
                and
                enabling people outside the organisation to customise them to match their brand colours.

                After four years of refinements, it’s incredibly rewarding to see the icon set being used across all
                platforms and types of collaterals at Setu.

                I believe it’s important for a designer to feel fulfilled, to take pride in their work, and to still
                appreciate a project even months later. For me, the icon system became exactly that—a project that
                taught me
                patience.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first glance, it may seem like just a set of icons, but the effort involved in conceptualising,
                designing, and, most importantly, overseeing its implementation on the design website—and seeing it
                adopted
                by other teams—was truly heartwarming.
